    {host, default},

    % Hostname for virtual host support. Change this to your real
    % hostname (e.g. www.example.com) once you move your site to
    % production.
    {hostname, "127.0.0.1:8000"},

    % Now you'll need to construct two keys. They should be short strings of random characters. Like good passwords, they should be hard to guess.

    % Key used for signing image urls with image manipulations (crop, rotate, resize, etc.)
    %  This key will help prevent denial of service attacks.
    % A new key will also forces regenerating images, which takes cpu time and will fill your hard disk.

    % Key used for signing postbacks - this _must_ be a hard to guess key, otherwise your system is insecure.
    % When not defined, then zotonic will generate a new key on every restart.
    % When a new key is generated then all postbacks from old html pages will fail.

%%
%% The configurations are for the Zotonic system itself.
%% Site configuration is found in each site's config file.
%% The site config files are in the subdirectories of priv/sites/.
%%
%% To use this configuration file:
%% 1. Make sure Zotonic is NOT running
%% 2. Copy this file to "config" (in this "priv" directory)
%% 3. Change (and uncomment) any setting you want to modify
%% 4. Start Zotonic.
%% 5. Check if Zotonic is using your new settings.
%%    - When not then you have made a configuration error, start Zotonic
%%      in debug mode with "./start.sh" or "zotonic.sh debug" 
%%
%%
%% Zotonic will rewrite the file when settings are changed by Zotonic.
%% Zotonic will ensure that there is a 'password' entry, adding it when necessary.
%%
%% Rarely used configurations are commented out, change at your own risk.
%% The given values are the defaults for the options.
%%
%% Be careful with the comma after each option, exclude it after the last option.

Zotonic Commands
================
The zotonic command can run a number of utility commands availble in
zotonic/bin.

OS X Compatibility Problem
--------------------------
If you symlink to zotonic/bin/zotonic, then you will need GNU coreutils on
OS X or `readlink -e` will fail.  I could not find a clean work-around for
this with built-in OS X CLI tools.  This is needed to traverse deeply
symlinked commands.

zotonic addsite [site_name]
--------------------------
Create a new site with [site_name] as its name.  This new site will be based
on the current content of the default site.  It uses the default site as a
template or skeleton.

zotonic copysite [site_name] [source_server]
--------------------------------------------
Copy [site_name] and its database content from the [source_server] over SSH
and load its content into the filesystem and database of the local machine.

You will need to have created the database zotonic_[site_name] for this to
work.

Warning: This command will reset the content of the database to the content
retrieved from the [source_server].  It does, however, generate and output
a restore file in case this was run by accident and explains how to recover.

zotonic createdb [site_name]
----------------------------
Create a database called zotonic_[site_name] with the basic setup in place to
host a Zotonic datastore.

This script will likely need to be run as postgres unless zotonic has been
granted CREATEDB in postgres as follows:

	ALTER ROLE zotonic WITH CREATEDB

zotonic debug
-------------
Launch the Zotonic server interactively and get an EShell on the running
instance.  This is very similar to running ./start.sh.

zotonic restart
---------------
Restart the background Zotonic server instance.

zotonic shell
-------------
Connect to the background Zotonic server instance and provide and EShell.

zotonic sitedir [site_name]
---------------------------
Get the absolute path for a site based on [site_name]

zotonic snapshot [site_name]
----------------------------
Take a version control snapshot of [site_name] including its database content.

This works differently from mod_backup in that it consistently uses the same
filename for the SQL backup to make revision-based full site rollbacks
possible.

zotonic start
-------------
Start the background Zotonic server instance.

zotonic stop
------------
Stop the background Zotonic server instance.

zotonic update
--------------
Update the server.  Compiles and loads any new code, flushes caches and
rescans all modules.
